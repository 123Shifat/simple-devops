# Test Objectives
- [ ] Test should be atomic ( independent test )
- [ ] Run test in parallel ( Scalability )
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns ( maintainability )
    - separate your code , config and data and not mix them up.
- [ ] Test should not mix intentions with implementation 
    - implementation of application logic should go in a seperate class ( page objects ).
    - intentions should stay in test.
- [ ] Version Control ( Git )
- [ ] backedup ( github ) 
- [ ] Collaborate ( with other team member )
- [ ] Reports
    - CI readable. 
    - Human readable html reports.
- [ ] Loggings
    - logging on various variables ( debug , info , errors ,  ).
- [ ] Notifications
    - when your test runs in CI , you should know what has happened ( on slack , via emails ).
- [ ] Run your tests in CI ( automatically ) 
    - triggering your tests with each pull request. 
    - triggering your tests on a schedule. 
    - Manually triggerings the build if the need may be
